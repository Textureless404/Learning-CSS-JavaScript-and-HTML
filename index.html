            <p>The <u><em>FitnessGram Pacer test</em></u> is a <strong>multistage aerobic capacity test</strong> that <em>progressively</em> gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter <strong>Pacer test</strong> will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal <em>*boop*</em>. A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound <strong>*ding*</strong>. Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.</p>
